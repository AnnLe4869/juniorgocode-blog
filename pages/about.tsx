        Hello world! I am Anh, a software engineer and soon to be a third year
        computer science student at University of California, San Diego. I start
        this blog with the purpose of helping other people and through that
        process also reinforce my learning.

        In my past time I enjoy learning new technologies or doing some small
        projects. Some of the most notable ones I have made is a clone of
        Evernote built with React and Firebase. The other one is called YelpCamp
        built with Node and has many features of the famous app Yelp.

        Other than programming I also play some games and read manga. My current
        favorite game is Genshin Impact and my favorite manga, well, it is hard
        to choose a favorite one. I read a lot of manga after all.
